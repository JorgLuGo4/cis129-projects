print("One day, an ordinary ant named Edward found himself working in the middle of the colony.")
print("He had always worked hard, but then something weird happened.. ")
print("Edward was chosen to become the new queen!")
print("As the new queen, Edward now ruled over the colony")
print("Oh but little did the other ants know... Edward was secretly a tyrant.")
print("And now with this new found authority, he ruled with an iron fist for all the years to come.")
